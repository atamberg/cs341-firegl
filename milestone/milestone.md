## Progress Summary

1. Summarize what you have accomplished so far.

	Enter your features from the proposal in the table below. For each feature, indicate whether you completed the implementation, it is work in progress, or you have to start it.

	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Feature</th>
				<th>Adapted Points</th>
				<th>Status</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Feature 1</td>
				<td>5</td>
				<td style="background-color: #d4edda;">Completed</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Feature 2</td>
				<td>5</td>
				<td style="background-color: #fff3cd;">Work in progress</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Feature 3</td>
				<td>10</td>
				<td style="background-color: #d4edda;">Completed</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Feature 4</td>
					<td>10</td>
					<td style="background-color: #cce5ff;">Upcoming</td>
				</tr>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Feature 5</td>
				<td>20</td>
				<td style="background-color: #fff3cd;">Work in progress</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	Add a brief summary of the goals achieved each week. A few words per cell are sufficient.

2. Show some preliminary results.

	![An image showing your progress.](images/demo.jpg){width="300px"}

	![A video showing your progress.](videos/demo.mp4){width="500px"}

	Briefly describe the results you obtained until now and the overall state of the project.

	TODO


3. Optionally present the validation of any feature you have already implemented. This is not mandatory, but can help you get useful feedback for the final report: feature validation will be the main component determining your grade. 

	Follow the following template for each feature you want to validate.

	- Feature Name

		- Implementation

			Briefly describe how you implemented the feature.

		- Validation

			Provide evidence (plots, screenshots, animations, etc.) that the feature works as expected.


4. Report the number of hours each team member worked on the project.

	<table>
		<caption>Worked Hours</caption>
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>Name 1</th>
			<th>Name 2</th>
			<th>Name 3</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Week 1 (Proposal)</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
			<td>Week 2 (Easter)</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Week 3</td>
			<td></td>

			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Week 4</td>

		</tr>
	</table>

5. Is the project progressing as expected? Was your workload estimate correct? Critically reflect on your work plan and assess if you are on track.

	TODO

## Schedule Update
