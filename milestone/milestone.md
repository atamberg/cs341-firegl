## Progress Summary

1. Summarize what you have accomplished so far.

	Enter your features from the proposal in the table below. For each feature, indicate whether you completed the implementation, it is work in progress, or you have to start it.

	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Feature</th>
				<th>Adapted Points</th>
				<th>Status</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Mesh and Scene Design</td>
				<td>5</td>
				<td style="background-color: #d4edda;">Work in progress</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bloom</td>
				<td>5</td>
				<td style="background-color: #fff3cd;">Upcoming</td>

	</table>

	Add a brief summary of the goals achieved each week. A few words per cell are sufficient.

2. Show some preliminary results.

	![A video showing your progress.](videos/demo.mp4){width="500px"}

	Briefly describe the results you obtained until now and the overall state of the project.

	TODO


3. Optionally present the validation of any feature you have already implemented. This is not mandatory, but can help you get useful feedback for the final report: feature validation will be the main component determining your grade. 

	Follow the following template for each feature you want to validate.

	- Feature Name

		- Implementation

			Briefly describe how you implemented the feature.

		- Validation

			Provide evidence (plots, screenshots, animations, etc.) that the feature works as expected.


4. Report the number of hours each team member worked on the project.

	<table>

## Schedule Update

1. Acknowledge any delays or unexpected issues, and motivate proposed changes to the schedule, if needed.

	We hadn't realized that Easter break ate into week 3, so we ended up losing that entire week by the time we began working on it on Wednesday. Though, given that we're caught up in the remaining time, we think we're on track.

2. Present the work plan for the remaining weeks.

		<tr>
